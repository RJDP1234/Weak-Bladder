# Weak Bladder

## Game Overview

**Weak Bladder** is an exciting game developed during the WANIC summer program, where players help a character reach the toilet in time. Navigate through a series of obstacles, traps, and puzzles to make it to the bathroom before it’s too late! This engaging gameplay encourages quick thinking and strategic planning, ensuring players have a blast while challenging their skills.

## Future Implementations

There are numerous possibilities for enhancing **Weak Bladder** in future updates:

- **Level Expansion**: Introducing new levels with unique challenges, traps, and obstacles to keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.
- **Power-ups**: Implementing power-ups that can help players navigate through levels faster or gain temporary advantages.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allowing players to compete against friends or family members in real-time, adding a fun social element to the game.
